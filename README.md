# Quantum-computing-calculator
Performing arithmetic operations  using quantum computing. Here's an example code for a simple quantum calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on n numbers using quantum computing

This code prompts the user to enter the number of numbers n, the n numbers themselves, and the operation they want to perform (+, -, *, or /). It then performs the operation on the numbers using the appropriate arithmetic operation, and prints the result in binary form using the bin function.

For addition and subtraction, the code simply uses Python's built-in sum function to add or subtract the numbers. For multiplication, it uses Python's built-in math.prod function to multiply the numbers. For division, it divides the first number by the product of the remaining numbers.

Note that this is just a simple example code and there are many ways to perform arithmetic operations on n numbers using quantum computing, depending on the algorithm and technique used.
